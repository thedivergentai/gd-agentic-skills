PROJECT SHOWCASE: gd-agentic-skills
The First "Long-Term Memory" (LTM) Architecture for Godot 4 AI Agents

THE CHALLENGE:
In AI-assisted development, a critical bottleneck exists: Contextual Hallucination. AI models trained on outdated data often write deprecated Godot 3.x code for Godot 4.5+ projects. This results in broken builds and hours of manual debugging.

THE INNOVATION:
"gd-agentic-skills" is a deterministic knowledge library designed specifically for AI Coding Agents. It functions as an external "Long-Term Memory" (LTM), instantly upgrading any AI Agent into a Godot 4.5+ Expert.

CORE ARCHITECTURE: BUILT FOR MACHINES
Unlike traditional documentation, this repository is optimized for Recursive Machine Discovery:

> SEMANTIC INDEXING: The "skills_index.json" provides a machine-readable map of keyword triggers and dependency chains.
> EXPERT KNOWLEDGE DELTA: Each skill focuses strictly on what matters—architectural patterns, API nuances, and specific optimizations that generalist models miss.
> ADVERSARIAL QA: Every skill was validated via a "Skill Judge" workflow, where one agent generates and another rigorously audits the implementation to ensure zero-hallucination.

THE LIBRARY AT A GLANCE:
- 82 ATOMIC MASTERY SKILLS: Full coverage of engine systems from Signal Architecture and Autoload Patterns to Advanced Shaders and Multiplayer Replication.
- 26 GENRE BLUEPRINTS: Production-ready architectural templates for genres like Metroidvania, RTS, MOBA, and Open-World Survival.
- AGENTIC IMPLEMENTATION: Verified .gd scripts that agents can ingest to deploy complex systems (like A* Pathfinding) with 100% architectural correctness.

THE IMPACT:
By treating AI not just as a text generator but as a system component requiring structured context, "gd-agentic-skills" represents the future of Agentic Software Engineering.
